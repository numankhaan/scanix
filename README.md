## About

`Scanix` is a simple Python-based port scanner with **basic OS fingerprinting**.
It attempts to identify the operating system of a target host by analyzing **TTL values** and reports open ports in a given range.

This tool is a lightweight alternative to larger scanners and is intended for **educational and experimental** use.

## Features

- Scans a range of TCP ports on a target host
- Guesses the operating system based on **TTL values**
- Prints detected **open ports** with OS guess
- Minimal and easy-to-read Python code

## Requirements

- Python **3.7+**
- `pyfiglet` (for ASCII banner)

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```

## Usage
<div align="left">

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/numankhaan/scanix.git
```
Move to Project Floder
```bash
cd scanix
```
Run the script

```bash
python PortScannerwithOSFingerprint.py <ip> <start_port> <end_port>
```
</div>

## Example
<div align="left">

```bash
python PortScannerwithOSFingerprint.py example.com 1 1000
```
This will scan ports 1â€“1000 on the host example.com and attempt to guess the OS.
